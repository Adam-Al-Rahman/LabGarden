How did we get Here? . In early stage to collect data we used Spreadsheets. CSV | Excel | . | . As the data grow the new technologies appeard . Relational DataBase(DB) MySQL (Query language to to CRUD operation) | . | . And as the data grow more and more. In 2000 we got the fancy term called Big data . Big data MongoDB (NoSQL) | . | . Now we have collect alot of data and to utilize that in Machine learning as data source. . Steps in a full Machine learning project . Data Science : To utilize the huge data. . Types of Machine Learning : . Supervised Learning : Classification. Classifying is this(relative) a apple or mango. | Regression. like predicting stock prices. | . | Unsupervised Learning : . Clustering. Making group of the similar data and then predict. | Assiciation Rule Learning. | . | Reinforcement Learning . Skill acquisiton. | Real time learning. | . | .",
