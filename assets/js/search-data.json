Narrow AI : The machine AI which is good at specifc task only one thing. . General AI : The AI machine which good at many task. . How did we get Here? . In early stage to collect data we used Spreadsheets. CSV | Excel | . | . As the data grow the new technologies appeard . Relational DataBase(DB) MySQL (Query language to to CRUD operation) | CRUD : Create Read Update Delete. | . | . And as the data grow more and more. In 2000 we got the fancy term called Big data . Big data MongoDB (NoSQL) | . | . Now we have collect alot of data and to utilize that in Machine learning as data source. . Steps in a full Machine learning project . Data Science : To utilize the huge data. . Types of Machine Learning : . Supervised Learning : . Classification. Classifying is this(relative) a apple or mango. | Regression. like predicting stock prices. | . | Semi-Supervised Learning : .
